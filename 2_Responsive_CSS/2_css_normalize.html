            Mt. Washington (6,288 feet) is the highest peak east of the Mississippi River and north of the Carolinas. The upper part of the mountain has a climate similar to that of northern Labrador and supports a variety of alpine flora and fauna.
            <br /><br />Mt. Adams (5,799 feet) is the second highest peak in New England, offering spectacular views across the Great Gulf and King Ravine.
            <br /><br />Mt. Jefferson (5,716 feet) has three summits a short distance apart, in line northwest and southeast, with the highest in the middle. Perhaps the most striking view is down the Great Gulf with the Carter Range beyond.
